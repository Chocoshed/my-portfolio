                            The theme for the game to create was "introduce programming".
                            
                            I chose to draw inspiration from a game from my childhood: PokÃ©mon.
                            
                            In this game, players can discover the basics of programming, starting with understanding the foundation of web development languages such as: HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL, ...
                            
                            For development, I decided to step out of my comfort zone. The language choice was free, so I went with React.js.
                            
                            I also created gifs to have quickly and easily animated characters, thanks to the pixelart site, [>here<](https://www.pixilart.com/chocoshed/albums/game-378425) are the gifs I used

                            This application, an extension added to an existing application, allows relevant IUT staff to manage absences and students.
                            
                            ## Main features:
                            - **Record absences**
                            - **Submit absence justifications**
                            - **View absences**
                            - **View student lists** (list + photo directory)
                            
                            ## Absence summary page
                            The most complex page of the project, which I had to revise several times. Initially developed solely in Twig, it now works entirely in JavaScript (as React is not used in the project).
