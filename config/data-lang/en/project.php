                            I chose to draw inspiration from a game from my childhood: PokÃ©mon.
                            
                            In this game, players can discover the basics of programming, starting with understanding the foundation of web development languages such as: HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL, ...
                            
                            For development, I decided to step out of my comfort zone. The language choice was free, so I went with React.js.
                            
                            I also created gifs to have quickly and easily animated characters, thanks to the pixelart site, [>here<](https://www.pixilart.com/chocoshed/albums/game-378425) are the gifs I used

                    ## What is a revenue manager?
                    A revenue manager is someone who helps hotels (or other businesses) earn more money by optimally managing their prices and bookings. Their job is to analyze sales, demand, and competition to decide, for example, at what price to sell rooms each day in order to optimize the hotel's revenue. It's a bit like being a conductor for rates and availability so that the hotel is as profitable as possible.

                    ## Need
                    This application arises from a specific need for a revenue manager in their daily tasks. They would like to have a better overview of each hotel they are responsible for, as well as the tasks related to them.

                    ## Planned features:
                    - a dashboard for each hotel (revenue, revenue trends, tasks, ...)
                    - tracking time spent per hotel
                    - ability to view/add tasks
                    - categorize tasks
                    - see who is assigned to a task

                    ## Technologies
                    - React
                    - Laravel
